      a) If you encounter a mouse problem, you should first try these options:
      1) If it is a first-time issue, restarting your PC can resolve the issue instantly.
      2) Confirm that the mouse or the wireless adaptor is firmly connected to the PC.
      3) You may also try to unplug the mouse cable or the wireless adaptor and reconnect using a different port.
      4)Check the mouse and the ports for damages and even try the mouse on a different computer.
      4 If none of these solves the problem, you can now proceed to other solutions.
      b) Troubleshoot Hardware and Devices
      c) Updating Incompatible Mouse Drivers
      d) Roll Back or Reinstall Mouse Drivers
      e) Deactivate Enhanced Pointer Precision
      f) Adjusting the Mouse Sensitivity
      g) Configure Touchpad Delay
      h) Disable Touchpad

  utter_Slow Internet:
  - text: If you are connecting wirelessly, then the location may be the problem. The signal is not necessarily strong in all corners of the building. Similarly, you could just be too far away. If this is not the issue, then spyware or viruses are a likely cause.

      First things to check are:
      1) Does the device work in a different USB port on the machine?
      2) Are other devices recognised in that port?
      3) Does the device work on another user’s machine?

  utter_Unexpected_ShutDown:
